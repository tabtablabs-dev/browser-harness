# browser-harness

Direct browser control via CDP. For task-specific edits, use `agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py` and `agent-workspace/domain-skills/`. For setup, install, or connection problems, read install.md.

## Usage

```bash
browser-harness -c '
new_tab("https://docs.browser-use.com")
wait_for_load()
print(page_info())
'
```

- Invoke as browser-harness — it's on $PATH. No cd, no uv run.
- First navigation is new_tab(url), not goto_url(url) — goto runs in the user's active tab and clobbers their work.

Available interaction skills:
- interaction-skills/connection.md — startup sequence, tab visibility, omnibox popup fix

Available domain skills:
- tiktok/upload.md
- polymarket/scraping.md

## Tool call shape

```bash
browser-harness -c '
# any python. helpers pre-imported. daemon auto-starts.
'
```

run.py calls ensure_daemon() before exec — you never start/stop manually unless you want to.

### Remote browsers

Use remote for parallel sub-agents (each gets its own isolated browser via a distinct BU_NAME) or on a headless server. BROWSER_USE_API_KEY must be set. start_remote_daemon, list_cloud_profiles, list_local_profiles, sync_local_profile are pre-imported.

```bash
browser-harness -c '
start_remote_daemon("work")                               # default — clean browser, no profile
# start_remote_daemon("work", profileName="my-work")      # reuse a cloud profile (already logged in)
# start_remote_daemon("work", profileId="<uuid>")         # same, but by UUID
# start_remote_daemon("work", proxyCountryCode="de", timeout=120)   # DE proxy, 2-hour timeout
# start_remote_daemon("work", proxyCountryCode=None)      # disable the Browser Use proxy
'

BU_NAME=work browser-harness -c '
new_tab("https://example.com")
print(page_info())
'
```

start_remote_daemon prints liveUrl and auto-opens it in the local browser (if a GUI is detected) so the user can watch along. Headless servers print only — share the URL with the user. The daemon PATCHes the cloud browser to stop on shutdown, which persists profile state. Running remote daemons bill until timeout.

Profiles (cookies-only login state) live in interaction-skills/profile-sync.md — covers list_cloud_profiles(), the chat-driven "which profile?" pattern, and sync_local_profile() for uploading a local Chrome profile.

### Kameleo local profiles

Use this for local Kameleo profiles. Kameleo owns the profile lifecycle; browser-harness attaches through the same BU_CDP_WS daemon path used for remote browsers.

```bash
browser-harness --kameleo-profile hh-networking-events-worker-1 -c 'print(page_info())'
```

Optional flags:
- `--kameleo-api http://127.0.0.1:5050` — override the Local API endpoint
- `--bu-name worker-1` — use a stable daemon/socket namespace; otherwise a unique name is generated

## Search first

Search `agent-workspace/domain-skills/` first for the domain you are working on before inventing a new approach.

Only if you start struggling with a specific mechanic while navigating, look in interaction-skills/ for helpers. The available interaction skills are:
- cookies.md
- cross-origin-iframes.md
- dialogs.md
- downloads.md
- drag-and-drop.md
- dropdowns.md
- iframes.md
- network-requests.md
- print-as-pdf.md
- profile-sync.md
- screenshots.md
- scrolling.md
- shadow-dom.md
- tabs.md
- uploads.md
- viewport.md

Useful commands:

```bash
rg --files agent-workspace/domain-skills
rg -n "tiktok|upload" agent-workspace/domain-skills
```

## Always contribute back

If you learned anything non-obvious about how a site works, open a PR to `agent-workspace/domain-skills/<site>/` before you finish. Default to contributing. The harness gets better only because agents file what they learn. If figuring something out cost you a few steps, the next run should not pay the same tax.

Examples of what's worth a PR:

- A private API the page calls (XHR/fetch endpoint, request shape, auth) — often 10× faster than DOM scraping.
- A stable selector that beats the obvious one, or an obfuscated CSS-module class to avoid.
- A framework quirk — "the dropdown is a React combobox that only commits on Escape", "this Vue list only renders rows inside its own scroll container, so scrollIntoView on the row doesn't work — you have to scroll the container".
- A URL pattern — direct route, required query params (?lang=en, ?th=1), a variant that skips a loader.
- A wait that wait_for_load() misses, with the reason.
- A trap — stale drafts, legacy IDs that now return null, unicode quirks, beforeunload dialogs, CAPTCHA surfaces.

### What a domain skill should capture

The *durable* shape of the site — the map, not the diary. Focus on what the next agent on this site needs to know before it starts:

- URL patterns and query params.
- Private APIs and their payload shape.
- Stable selectors (data-*, aria-*, role, semantic classes).
- Site structure — containers, items per page, framework, where state lives.
- Framework/interaction quirks unique to this site.
- Waits and the reasons they're needed.
- Traps and the selectors that *don't* work.

### Do not write

- Raw pixel coordinates. They break on viewport, zoom, and layout changes. Describe how to *locate* the target (selector, scrollIntoView, aria-label, visible text) — never where it happened to be on your screen.
- Run narration or step-by-step of the specific task you just did.
- Secrets, cookies, session tokens, user-specific state. `agent-workspace/domain-skills/` is shared and public.

## What actually works

- Screenshots first: use capture_screenshot() to understand the current page quickly, find visible targets, and decide whether you need a click, a selector, or more navigation.
- Clicking: capture_screenshot() → read the pixel off the image → click_at_xy(x, y) → capture_screenshot() to verify. Suppress the Playwright-habit reflex of "locate first, then click" — no getBoundingClientRect, no selector hunt. Drop to DOM only when the target has no visible geometry (hidden input, 0×0 node). Hit-testing happens in Chrome's browser process, so clicks go through iframes / shadow DOM / cross-origin without extra work.
- Bulk HTTP: http_get(url) + ThreadPoolExecutor. No browser for static pages (249 Netflix pages in 2.8s).
- After goto: wait_for_load().
- Wrong/stale tab: ensure_real_tab(). Use it when the current tab is stale or internal; the daemon also auto-recovers from stale sessions on the next call.
- Verification: print(page_info()) is the simplest "is this alive?" check, but screenshots are the default way to verify whether a visible action actually worked.
- DOM reads: use js(...) for inspection and extraction when the screenshot shows that coordinates are the wrong tool.
- Iframe sites (Azure blades, Salesforce): click_at_xy(x, y) passes through; only drop to iframe DOM work when coordinate clicks are the wrong tool.
- Auth wall: redirected to login → stop and ask the user. Don't type credentials from screenshots.
- Raw CDP for anything helpers don't cover: cdp("Domain.method", params).

## Design constraints

- Coordinate clicks default. Input.dispatchMouseEvent goes through iframes/shadow/cross-origin at the compositor level.
- Connect to the user's running Chrome. Don't launch your own browser.
- cdp-use is only for CDPClient.send_raw. Prefer raw CDP strings over typed wrappers.
- run.py stays tiny. No argparse, subcommands, or extra control layer.
- Core helpers stay short. Put task-specific helper additions in `agent-workspace/agent_helpers.py`; daemon/bootstrap and remote session admin live in the core package.
- Don't add a manager layer. No retries framework, session manager, daemon supervisor, config system, or logging framework.

## Gotchas (field-tested)

- Omnibox popups are fake page targets. Filter chrome://omnibox-popup... and other internals when you need a real tab.
- CDP target order != Chrome's visible tab-strip order. Use UI automation when the user means "the first/second tab I can see"; Target.activateTarget only shows a known target.
- Default daemon sessions can go stale. ensure_real_tab() re-attaches to a real page.
- Browser Use API is camelCase on the wire. cdpUrl, proxyCountryCode, etc.
- Remote cdpUrl is HTTPS, not ws. Resolve the websocket URL via /json/version.
- Stop cloud browsers with PATCH /browsers/{id} + {"action":"stop"}.
- After every meaningful action, re-screenshot before assuming it worked. Use the image to verify changed state, open menus, navigation, visible errors, and whether the page is in the state you expected.
- Use screenshots to drive exploration. They are often the fastest way to find the next click target, notice hidden blockers, and decide if a selector is even worth writing.
- Prefer compositor-level actions over framework hacks. Try screenshots, coordinate clicks, and raw key input before adding DOM-specific workarounds.
- If you need framework-specific DOM tricks, check interaction-skills/ first. That is where dropdown, dialog, iframe, shadow DOM, and form-specific guidance belongs.

## Interaction notes

- interaction-skills/ holds reusable UI mechanics such as dialogs, tabs, dropdowns, iframes, and uploads.
- `agent-workspace/domain-skills/` holds site-specific workflows and should be updated when you discover reusable patterns for a website.
